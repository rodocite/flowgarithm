## Algorithms
Algorithm / Toy repo for fun and profit. Mostly to familiarize myself with Flow.
Using Jest, but will replace that if something new comes along that's interesting to try out.

```
yarn install
yarn run test
yarn run transpose_matrix
```

Constantly WIP. I may have missed a test case or two in my specs.

TODO:
- comment in algorithm description
- better test cases
- command to erase all solutions
- command to scaffold a toy / spec
